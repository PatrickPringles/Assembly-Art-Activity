An Assembly program that outputs a face of some random character. Here, you can see my attempt in making a Creeper face from Minecraft.

Just do the following:
1. nasm -f elf Steve3.asm
2. ld -m elf_i386 -s -o Steve3 Steve3.o
3. ./Steve3

Note: You need a NASM compiler for this to work. Use Ubuntu for an easier compilation process

Thanks for reading this!
